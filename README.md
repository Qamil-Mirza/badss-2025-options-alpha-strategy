# Berkeley IEOR + Wells Fargo BADSS Case Competition
## **Optimizing Equity Derivative Hedging Strategies**

## **Overview**
This project is a submission for the **Berkeley Algorithm Design & Systems Solutions (BADSS) Case Competition**, hosted by the **Berkeley IEOR Department** in collaboration with **Wells Fargo**. 

The competition focuses on **developing an optimization model** for **equity derivative hedging** under different market scenarios. Participants are provided with a dataset containing **call options** for **SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq 100), and IWM (Russell 2000)**. The goal is to design a trading strategy that:

- **Maintains a minimum exposure of +$10,000,000** under a specified market movement scenario.
- **Minimizes the total option premium cost** across the given timeframe.
- **Tracks daily exposure and profitability**, ensuring no negative exposure under any scenario.

## **Project Structure**
I WILL FILL THIS IN LATER LMAO I NEED SLEEP BRO RIP QUAMIL

## **Installation & Setup**
Setup is very minimal at the moment as we just need `python 3.x, numpy, matplotlib, pandas`. I have created an environment.yml file to manage dependencies as a "just in case" measure for when the project expands. For now, a simple `pip install numpy matplotlib pandas` will suffice.
